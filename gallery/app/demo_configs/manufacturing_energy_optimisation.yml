business_problem: A common challenges in manufacturing is energy optimisation. Client demand has to be met while trying to optmise the manufacturing process. Each manufacturing job (a job is a planned operation to produce specific material or objects like aluminium, metal eyelets, etc) is usually scheduled on a specific machine at a specific time with a specific set of configuration. With this data, we can understand how much energy the machine will require to run a job with some setup, and eventually optimise the job schedule to avoid energy peak load.
business_value: 
  - Insights into energy consumptions of machines
  - Target KPI is energy Savings
accelerator_description: This demos shows (1) an AI model assessment to enable plant operator to review how the model is performing (2) the energy profile for a job schedule (3) how changes in machine configuration impact the energy consumption
modeling_approach_and_training: The model is a simple linear regression as the energy consumption is mostly affected linearly by factors such as machine power, speed, etc.
value:
  - Quickly setup a demo for operators to review your model's performances
  - Enable operators to experiment with new configurations to evaluate 
  - Once the energy of a specific job is known, an extension for this demo would be to show an optimised week schedule.
data: the data represents typical machinery configuration (pressure, speed, etc) and the energy consumption in KWH.
architecture:
  - Azure App Services
  - Streamlit
